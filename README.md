      director: "Julie Taymor",
      description: "Her portrait, with that thick unibrow and un-waxed upper lip, has become an iconic symbol of feminism. Julie Taymor's biopic takes us behind the canvas to reveal the artist, the activist, the revolutionary. And knowing what we do now about lead actress Selma Hayek's off-screen experience, this film proves an even greater victory.",

      description: "Disney has a way of making us feel like pawns in a game of Let's See How Hard We Can Make Them Cry. But that's not the case with Mira Nair's feel-good drama about a Uganda girl's path to chess champ, adapted from an ESPN sports essay. Moms and dads, you want your daughters to grow up to be chess champions.",

      director: "Marjane Satrapi",
      description: "There's a lot at play here: Persepolis is animated like a graphic novel. It's done in black and white. It's about a girl who defies Islamic fundamentalists. It's autobiographical. And it's in French. The result: a brilliant feminist feat from Marjane Satrapi.",

      description: "Feminism isn't all \"women can do anything men can do\"—it's women can do whatever the hell they want to do. And for the protagonist sisters in Gillian Anderson's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel, that means a writer, a musician, a housewife and a free spirit.",

      description: "Susan Sarandon and Gena Davis lock arms—and fates—in this buddy road trip drama with a feminist legacy that runs deeper than the Grand Canyon. Sure, it's directed by Ridley Scott, but the screenplay about a pair of outlaws who are anything but passive comes straight from the pen of Callie Khouri.",
